# Collatz-Conjecture-calculation
I've created this program because I was interested in the famous Collatz Conjecture (3x+1). It is written in python an d has two modes, first for automatic generating and second for manual inserting of the numbers. As the output the program will write to the file output.txt or directlly to the cosole in the second mode scenario. You can then paste these to your sheet editor like LibreOffice Calc or Excel etc. and create graphs with it (Or pretty much anything else). 

## Installation / Run
You just need to clone this entire repository by "git clone" on your computer and then run the program with python/python3 main.py

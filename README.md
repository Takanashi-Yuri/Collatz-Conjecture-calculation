# Collatz-Conjecture-calculation
I've created this program because I was interested in the famous Collatz Conjecture (3x+1). It is written in python an d has two modes, first for automatic generating and second for manual inserting of the numbers. As the output the program will write to the file output.txt or directlly to the cosole in the second mode scenario. You can then paste these to your sheet editor like LibreOffice Calc or Excel etc. and create graphs with it (Or pretty much anything else). 

## Installation / Run
You just need to clone this entire repository by "git clone" on your computer and then run the program with python/python3 main.py

## Usage of sheet editors
To use your output with sheet edit you must copy output in output.txt file or in the console (Only for manual insert) and past it in your sheet. Then sellect separator as Semicolon, and your data will be pasted in two columns for good compatibility with charts.

## Tips
* When running automatic generating of the numbers check if output.txt file is empty to not mess your data. The program will just bassically continue after the last line in the file, so you can get very long text you must skip.

## To-do
- [ ] Upgrade output for sheets to be more readable ans visible.
